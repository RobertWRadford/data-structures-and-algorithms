# Linked Lists

## Challenge
Create a node class and a linked list class that keeps track of sequential order for objects of the class

## Approach & Efficiency
I set up the initial Node class to take in the value and a next property that is initiated as None, and also gave it a str method to return its value in a string format. Next I created the LinkedList class with a value of head that is initiated as None
